      <h1>Effect of Temperature and Flow Rate on Kinetics of Cumene Production in a Trickle Bed Reactor from α-methylstyrene and Hydrogen</h1>
      <div>This report presents an experimental investigation of the reaction between α-methylstyrene (AMS) and hydrogen to produce cumene in a Trickle Bed Reactor (TBR) using Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The temperature and flow rates of AMS and hydrogen were varied to study their impact on the reaction. Gas Chromatography (GC) was used to analyze the concentration of cumene at different time intervals. The results revealed first-order kinetics with respect to hydrogen and zeroth order with respect to AMS, and an activation energy of 55.33 kJ/mol. Scaling up the reactor and cost analysis showed potential for profit. Some discrepancies in mass transfer data were attributed to the unique reactor setup, and recommendations for future work were provided.</div>
